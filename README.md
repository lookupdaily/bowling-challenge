# Bowling-Challenge #

The screens are down at the local bowling alley and this programme is here to help you keep track of your score so you can still play the game. It's a one-player score card, so each player will need to run their own app.

*Tech used*

I created this programme as part of a challenge at [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy). See [Specification](#Specification) for more information on the programme's requirements, and [How I built it](#How-i-built-it) for an insight into my planning.

## Getting Started ##

1. Fork this repo, and clone to your local machine. Navigate into the folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

## How to play ##

### Scoring ###

There are 10 turns(frames) in a game. In each game you get two rolls. Enter your two rolls and click to submit. The scorecard will store your rolls and calculate your score using the following rules.

In [traditional scoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Traditional_scoring), one point is scored for each pin that is knocked over, and when less than all ten pins are knocked down in two rolls in a frame, the frame is scored with the total number of pins knocked down. However, when all ten pins are knocked down with either the first or second rolls of a frame, bonus pins are awarded as follows:

- **Strike:** When all ten pins are knocked down on the first roll (marked "X" on the scoresheet), the frame receives ten pins plus a bonus of pinfall on the next two rolls (not necessarily the next two frames). A strike in the tenth (final) frame receives two extra rolls for bonus pins.

- **Spare:** When a second roll of a frame is needed to knock down all ten pins (marked "/" on the scoresheet), the frame receives ten pins plus a bonus of pinfall in the next roll (not necessarily the next frame). A spare in the first two rolls in the tenth (final) frame receives a third roll for bonus pins.

### Special games ###

- **Gutter game**: when the player never hits a pin (20 zero scores)
- **Perfect game**: when the player rolls 12 strikes (10 regular strikes and 2 strikes for the bonus in the 10th frame). The Perfect Game scores 300 points.

### Objects ###

I roughly diagrammed each object required, its attributes, methods and events needed.

### Designing Tests 

When planning my code I thought about the tests I might need, and tried to order them by simplicity.

#### Feature tests

- One frame
- Multiple frames
- Gutter game
- Spares
- Strikes
- Final Frame

#### Unit tests

### Thinking about UI

When planning out user interaction and the scoring system, it was helpful to roughly sketch out the UI. Mobile design developed for fun (and an additional challenge).

#### Score card and user input

User enters scores and clicks submit. Interface updates turn, prints rolls and calculates score.

#### Mobile UI

Scorecard and user-input arranged to 7x4 grid.
