# Bowling-Challenge #

The screens are down at the local bowling alley and this programme is here to help you keep track of your score so you can still play the game. It's a one-player score card, so each player will need to run their own app.

*Tech used*

I created this programme as part of a challenge at [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy). See [Specification](#Specification) for more information on the programme's requirements, and [How I built it](#How-i-built-it) for an insight into my planning.

### Scoring ###

In [traditional scoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Traditional_scoring), one point is scored for each pin that is knocked over, and when less than all ten pins are knocked down in two rolls in a frame (an open frame, the frame is scored with the total number of pins knocked down. However, when all ten pins are knocked down with either the first or second rolls of a frame (a mark), bonus pins are awarded as follows:

- **Strike:** When all ten pins are knocked down on the first roll (marked "X" on the scoresheet), the frame receives ten pins plus a bonus of pinfall on the next two rolls (not necessarily the next two frames). A strike in the tenth (final) frame receives two extra rolls for bonus pins.

- **Spare:** When a second roll of a frame is needed to knock down all ten pins (marked "/" on the scoresheet), the frame receives ten pins plus a bonus of pinfall in the next roll (not necessarily the next frame). A spare in the first two rolls in the tenth (final) frame receives a third roll for bonus pins.

### Special games ###

- **Gutter game**: when the player never hits a pin (20 zero scores)
- **Perfect game**: when the player rolls 12 strikes (10 regular strikes and 2 strikes for the bonus in the 10th frame). The Perfect Game scores 300 points.

## How I built it ##

### Domain modelling ###

### Object tables ###

### Designing Tests ###

When planning my code I thought about the tests I might need, and tried to order them by simplicity

#### Feature tests ####

- One frame
- Multiple frames
- Gutter game
- Spares
- Strikes
- Final Frame

#### Unit tests ####

### Thinking about UI ##

When planning out user interaction and the scoring system, it was helpful to roughly sketch out the UI. Mobile design developed for fun (and an additional challenge).
